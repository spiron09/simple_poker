# üÉè Simple Poker on Solana

A fully decentralized, peer-to-peer poker/dice game built on the Solana blockchain. This project uses an Anchor program for the on-chain logic and a Next.js frontend for a modern, reactive user experience.

## üéÆ How to Play

This game is deployed on the Solana **Devnet**. To play, you will need a Solana-compatible wallet and some Devnet SOL for transaction fees and stakes.

### Player Prerequisites

1. **A Solana Wallet:** Install a browser extension wallet like [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) or [Solflare](https://solflare.com/).
2. **Devnet SOL:** You need some "play" money to interact with the game. You can get free Devnet SOL from a faucet:
    - **Easiest Method (Web):** Go to a web faucet like [solfaucet.com](https://solfaucet.com/), select "Devnet", enter your wallet address, and request an airdrop.
    - **Developer Method (CLI):** If you have the Solana CLI installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        solana airdrop 2 <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS> --url devnet
        ```

### Game Walkthrough

#### 1. Connect Your Wallet

Click the **"Select Wallet"** button at the top right of the page and approve the connection in your wallet.

#### 2. Initialize the Lobby

If you are the first person to use the app after deployment, an **"Initialize Lobby"** button will appear. Click this once to set up the on-chain program. After this, the button will show "Lobby Ready".

#### 3. Join or Create a Game

You have two choices, accessible via the main tabs:

- **Join Game:** Find a game card with a green "open" status and click the "Join Game" button. This will require a transaction to stake your SOL.
- **Create Game:** Navigate to the "Create Game" tab. Enter the amount of SOL you want to stake and the maximum number of players, then click "Create".

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Creating Games
>
> Due to the current program logic, only one game can be active at a time.
>
> A new game can only be created after the winner of the previous game has successfully clicked **"Claim Prize"**. This resets the state and allows for a new game to begin.

#### 4. Determine the Winner

Once a game is full (e.g., `2 / 2` players), its status will change to "inProgress". Any player who joined that game can then click the **"Roll for Winner"** button. This triggers the on-chain logic that randomly selects a winner from the list of players.

#### 5. Claim Your Winnings

If you are the winner, the button on the game card will change to **"Claim Prize"**. Click it to transfer the entire prize pool to your wallet. Congratulations!

If you didn't win, the button will show a "Better Luck Next Time" message.
